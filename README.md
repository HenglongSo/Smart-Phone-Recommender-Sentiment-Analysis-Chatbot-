# Smart-Phone-Recommender-Sentiment-Analysis-Chatbot-


The main idea of our project is based on the knowledge of NLTK package from lecture to build a human-AI reacting interface leaning on the result of natural language process sentimental analysis. Given the training data, the algorithm is able to predict the sentiment score for specific brand and model. 


Our outline of the project can be generally divided into 3 steps: 

1-Dataset interpreting and data cleansing. 
2-Sentiment analysis model build and trained based on the extracted and cleansed data.  
3-Recommendation system frame design, including chatbot interaction dialog followed with query generation, prediction and AI advising based on the result of sentimental analysis score.
